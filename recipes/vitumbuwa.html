        <li>Warm the milk and combine with yeast in a large bowl. Stir lightly and let sit until mixture is foamy (about 5 mins)</li>
        <li>Beat eggs, butter, sugar, salt into the yeast mixture.
            Add half the flour (2 cups +2 tbs) mix until combined then add the remainder and mix until dough pulls away from sides of bowl. Add more flour 2 tbs at a time if dough is too wet.
            Transfer to floured surface and gently knead until smooth. Grease large bowl with a little oil and transfer dough to the bowl. Let it rise at room temperature until double the size about 1 hour</li>
        <li>Turn the dough out onto well floured surface and roll it to 1/2 inch thickness. Cut out the donuts with cutters or drinking glass. (If making holed donuts, cut out small holes in the middle with a shot glass</li>
        <li>Put the donuts on floured baking sheets with enough room between them. Let rise in a warm place until slightly puffed up about 45 mins.</li>
        <li>About 15 mins before donuts are done rising, put oil in heavy bottomed pot over medium heat.
            Line cooling racks with paper towels</li>
        <li>Carefully add donuts to the oil a few at a time. Deep fry until deep golden brown all over.</li>
    </ol>
